            <div class="solution-label">Solution:</div>
            <p>Part (i) is straightforward, since sums and scalar multiples of expressions of the form \(i_1x_1 +\cdots + i_nx_n\), with each \(i_j\in I\) and \(x_j\in M\), clearly have this form. For (ii), a typical element in \(I\) has the form \(\sum_j i_jz_j\) with each \(i_j\in I\) and \(z_j\) in \(M\). Each \(z_j\) has the form \(\sum_k a_{jk}x_k\), for \(a_{jk}\in R\) and \(x_k \in X\). Thus, a typical element in \(I\) can be written as \(\sum_j i_j(\sum _k a_{jk}x_k) = \sum_k (\sum_ji_ja_{jk}) x_k\), which gives what we want.</p>
            
            <p>For (iii), \(M/IM\) is an abelian group. To make \(M/IM\) into an \(R/I\)-module, define scalar multiplications as follows: \((r+I)\cdot (m+IM) := rm+IM\). Suppose \(r+I = r'+I\) and \(m+IM = m'+IM\). Then \(r-r' \in I\) and \(m-m'\in IM\). Thus, \((r-r')m \in IM\) and \(r'(m-m') \in IM\). Adding, we obtain \(rm-r'm'\in IM\), so \(rm+IM = r'm'+IM\), and therefore scalar multiplication is well defined. The required scalar multiplication axioms are automatically inherited from the existing \(R\)-module structure on \(M\), e.g.</p>
            
            <div class="math-display">
                \[(r+I)\{(s+I)(m+IM)\} = (r+I) (sm+IM) = r(sm)+IM = (rs)m+IM = \{(r+I)(s+I)\}(m+IM).\]
            </div>
            
            <p>For (iv), if \(IM = 0\), then \(M/IM = M\), so the first statement follows from part (iii) and \((r+I)m = rm\), for all \(r\in R\) and \(m\in M\). Now, suppose \(N\subseteq M\) is an \(R\)-submodule of \(M\). Then \(N\) is an abelian subgroup of \(M\) and moreover, for all \(r\in R\) and \(n \in N\): \((r+I)n = rn\), since \(IN = 0\). Thus, any \(R\)-submodule of \(M\) is also an \(R/I\)-submodule of \(M\) and conversely.</p>

            <p>For (i), clearly \(\pi\) is surjective. We check that \(\pi\) is an \(R\)-module homomorphism.

Then \(m-m'\in N\subseteq \ker(\phi)\), so that \(\phi(m-m') = 0\). Thus, \(\phi(m) = \phi(m')\), showing that \(\overline{\phi}\) is well defined. We have \(\overline{\phi}((m+N)+(m'+N)) = \overline{\phi}((m+m')+N) = \phi(m+m') = \phi(m)+\phi(m') = \overline{\phi}(m+N)+\overline{\phi}(m'+N)\), and \(\overline{\phi}(r(m+N)) = \overline{\phi}(rm+N) = \phi(rm) = r\phi(m) = r\overline{\phi}(m+N)\).

We need to show that \(\overline{\beta}\) is an isomorphism. Since \(\beta\) is surjective and \(\beta = \overline{\beta}\circ \pi\), it follows that \(\overline{\beta}\) is surjective. Now, suppose \(\overline{\beta}(m+\alpha(L)) = 0\). Then \(\beta(m) = 0\), so that \(m\in \ker(\beta) = \alpha(L)\).

Thus, \(\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta_{ij}-p_{ij})x_j = 0\), where \(\delta_{ij}\) is the Kronecker delta. Let \(A\) be the \(n\times n\) matrix with \((i,j)\)-entry \(\delta_{ij}-p_{ij}\).

            <p>Suppose there are infinitely many distinct maximal ideals of \(R\), say \(P_1, P_2, \ldots\). Then we have a descending chain of ideals \(P_1 \supseteq P_1\cap P_2\supseteq \cdots\). Thus, for some \(n\geq 1\), \(P_1\cap \cdots \cap P_n = P_1\cap \cdots \cap P_n\cap P_{n+1}\). It follows that \(P_1\cap \cdots \cap P_n \subseteq P_{n+1}\). Since \(P_{n+1}\) is a prime ideal, we have \(P_i \subseteq P_{n+1}\), for some \(1\leq i\leq n\). Since \(P_{n+1}\) is a maximal ideal, we have the contradiction \(P_i = P_{n+1}\). Thus, \(R\) has finitely many maximal ideals.</p>
            
            <p>For (ii), on the one hand, since \(R\) is Artinian, there exists \(n_0\geq 1\) such that \(J^n= J^{n+1}\), for all \(n\geq n_0\), since \(J\supseteq J^2\supseteq \cdots\). On the other hand, suppose \(J^n \not = 0\). Then there exists \(x_1\in J^n\) such that \(x_1J^n \not = 0\), since if \(x_1J^n = 0\) for all \(x_1\in J^n\), \(J^n J^n = J^{2n} = J^n = 0\), a contradiction. Now choose \(x_2\in J^n\) such that \(x_1x_2J^n \not = 0\). We can do this, otherwise, \(x_1x_2J^n = 0\) for all \(x_2\in J^n\), and thus \(0 = x_1J^nJ^n = x_1J^n = 0\), contradicting the choice of \(x_1\). Thus, inductively, we can find \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, \in J^n\), such that for all \(c\geq 1\), \(x_1\cdots x_cJ^n \not = 0\). Now, the descending chain \(\langle x_1\rangle \supseteq \langle x_1x_2\rangle \supseteq \cdots\) must stabilize. Thus, for some \(e\geq 1\), we can write \(x_1\cdots x_e = rx_1\cdots x_ex_{e+1}\), for some \(r\in R\). Thus, \((1-rx_{e+1})x_1\cdots x_e = 0\). Since \(x_{e+1} \in J\), \(1-rx_{e+1}\) is a unit. Thus, \(x_1\cdots x_e= 0\), a contradiction. Therefore, we must have \(J^n = 0\), as required.</p>
            
            <p>For (iii), we use the fact that if \(V\) is a vector space over the field \(F\), then \(V\) is finite dimensional if and only if \(V\) is an Artinian \(F\)-module if and only if \(V\) is a Noetherian \(F\)-module. We now proceed by induction on \(r\), to show that \(R/P^r\) is Noetherian for all \(r\geq 1\). Since \(P^n = 0\), it follows that \(R\) is a Noetherian ring. To proceed, if \(r = 1\), then \(F := R/P\) is a field and thus Noetherian. Now suppose \(R/P^r\) is a Noetherian ring. Then \(R/P^r\) is also a Noetherian \(R\)-module. Consider the natural exact sequence of \(R\)-modules:</p>
            
            <div class="math-display">
                \[0\to P^r/P^{r+1}\to R/P^{r+1} \to R/P^n\to 0.\]
            </div>
            
            <p>Since \(P\cdot (P^r/P^{r+1}) = 0\), \(P^r/P^{r+1}\) is a vector space over \(F\) and its subspace structure as a vector space over \(F\) is the same as its submodule structure as an \(R\)-module, by Problem 1 (iv). Now, \(R\) is Artinian, and hence \(R/P^{r+1}\) is an Artinian \(R\)-module, and hence its submodule \(P^r/P^{r+1}\) is an Artinian \(R\)-module, and therefore an Artinian \(R/P\)-module, i.e., a finite dimensional vector space over \(F\). Thus, \(P^r/P^{r+1}\) is a Noetherian \(R/P\)-module, and hence a Noetherian \(R\)-module. The induction hypothesis, together with the exact sequence above (and a theorem from class) give \(R/P^{r+1}\) is a Noetherian \(R\)-module, and hence a Noetherian ring. Thus, \(R/P^r\) is Noetherian for all \(r\), which is what we want. <span class="qed">∎</span></p>

            <p>for all \(r\geq 1\) (see the comments below). By Problem 8 (ii), we have \(J^n = 0\), for some \(n\geq 1\). Thus, as \(R\)-modules, we have</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>where the third isomorphism follows by the Chinese remainder theorem. It now follows from Problem 6 and induction on \(k\) that each \(R/P_i^r\) is an Artinian \(R\)-module, and hence an Artinian ring. Suppose \(Q\subseteq R/P_i^r\) is a maximal ideal. Then \(Q = P/P_i^r\), for a maximal ideal \(P\subseteq R\) containing \(P_i^r\), by the correspondence theorem. Since \(P\) is prime, \(P_i\subseteq P\), and since \(P_i\) is maximal, \(P = P_i\). Thus, \(P_i/P_i^r\) is the only maximal ideal of \(R/P_i^r\) and \((P_i/P_i^r)^r = 0\). Thus, by Problem 8 (iii), \(R/P_i^r\) is a Noetherian ring, and hence a Noetherian \(R\)-module, for each \(1\leq i\leq k\). It follows that \(R\cong R/P_1^r\oplus \cdots \oplus R/P_k^r\) is a Noetherian \(R\)-module, and hence a Noetherian ring. <span class="qed">∎</span></p>

        <div class="problem-number">Comments on the Chinese Remainder Theorem</div>
        
        <p>Throughout these comments \(I, J\subseteq R\) are ideals.</p>
        
        <p><strong>(i)</strong> \(I, J\subseteq R\) are said to be co-maximal if there is no maximal ideal of \(R\) containing both \(I\) and \(J\). Since every ideal of \(R\) is contained in a maximal ideal, this is equivalent to the condition \(I+J = R\), which in turn is equivalent to \(i+j = 1\), for some \(i\in I\) and \(j\in J\).</p>
        
        <p><strong>(ii)</strong> Suppose \(I\) and \(J\) are co-maximal, and \(x\in I\cap J\). Write \(1= i+j\), for \(i\in I\) and \(j\in J\). Then \(x = xi+xj \in IJ\). Thus, \(I\cap J \subseteq IJ\). Since \(IJ\subseteq I\cap J\) always holds, we have that if \(I\) and \(J\) are co-maximal, then \(I\cap J = IJ\).</p>
        
        <p><strong>(iii)</strong> Suppose that \(I\) and \(J\) are co-maximal. Define \(\phi: R\to (R/I)\oplus (R/J)\), by \(\phi (r) = (r+I, r+J)\). It is easy to check that \(\phi\) is a ring homomorphism. Clearly, \(I\cap J\) is the kernel of \(\phi\). Now suppose \((a+I, b+J) \in(R/I)\oplus (R/J)\). Take \(i\in I\) and \(j\in J\) such that \(i+j = 1\). Then \(ai+aj = a\), so that \(a+I = aj+I\). Similarly, \(bi+bj = b\), so that \(b+J = bi+J\). It follows that \(\phi (aj+bi) = (aj+bi+I, aj+bi+J) = (aj+I, bi+J) = (a+I, b+J)\), so that \(\phi\) is surjective. Thus, we have \(R/(I\cap J) \cong (R/I)\oplus (R/J)\). This also yields \(R/IJ\cong (R/I)\oplus (R/J)\).</p>
        
        <p><strong>(iv)</strong> Ideals \(I_1, \ldots, I_k\) are pairwise co-maximal, if for each \(1\leq i\not = j\leq k\), \(I_i\) and \(I_j\) are co-maximal. Given (iii) above, one can show via induction on \(k\), that if \(I_1, \ldots, I_k\) are co-maximal, then \(R/(I_1\cap \cdots \cap I_k)\cong (R/I_1)\oplus \cdots \oplus (R/I_k)\). Indeed, since \(I_1\) and \(I_2\cap \cdots \cap I_k\) are comaximal, we have</p>
