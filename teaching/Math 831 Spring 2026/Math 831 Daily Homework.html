            <p><strong>1.</strong> Consider the sequence of polynomial rings \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\subseteq \mathbb{Q}[x^{\frac{1}{2}}] \subseteq \mathbb{Q}[x^{\frac{1}{4}}]\subseteq \cdots\) and set \(R := \bigcup_{n\geq 1}\mathbb{Q}[x^{\frac{1}{2^n}}]\). Prove that if \(f \in R\) and the constant term of \(f\) is 0, then \(f\) is not an irreducible element in the integral domain \(R\). Conclude that no element in \(R\) with zero constant term can be written as a product of irreducible elements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>2.</strong> Let \(R\) be the ring in problem 1 and \(S\subseteq R\) be the multiplicatively closed set of polynomials with non-zero constant term. Prove that the ring \(R_S\) has no irreducible elements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Aside.</strong> In the literature, irreducible elements are sometimes called <em>atoms</em>, for obvious reasons. An integral domain in which each non-zero, non-unit be factored (not necessarily uniquely) as a product of a finite number of atoms (irreducible elements) is called an <em>atomic domain</em>. An integral domain without any atoms is then called an <em>anti-matter</em> integral domain. Thus, the ring \(R_S\) in problem 2 is an anti-matter integral domain. This latter designation has absolutely nothing to do with physics, but was probably coined for the amusement of mathematicians who study such rings.</p>

In particular, this means that for each \(1\leq i\leq n\), we cannot insert an extra submodule in the chain above between \(M_{i-1}\) and \(M_i\). Prove that \(M\) has a composition series if and only if \(M\) is both Artinian and Noetherian.</p>
            
            <p><strong>2.</strong> Prove that if \(M\) has a composition series, then any two composition series have the same length.

If these conditions hold, prove that \(\lambda(B) = \lambda(A)+\lambda(C)\).</p>

            <p><strong>1.</strong> Use the Krull principal ideal theorem and the prime avoidance lemma to prove the following statement. Let \(R\) be a Noetherian ring, and suppose there exist prime ideals \(P_0\subsetneq P_1\subsetneq P_2\). Then there exist infinitely many prime ideals \(P'\) satisfying \(P_0\subsetneq P'\subsetneq P_2\). Here is the version of prime avoidance to use: Let \(P_1, \ldots, P_n\) be prime ideals in \(R\). For \(I\subseteq R\) an ideal, assume \(I\subseteq P_1\cup \cdots\cup P_n\). Then \(I\subseteq P_i\), for some \(i\).</p>
            
            <p><strong>2.</strong> Let \(R\) be a commutative ring and \(f(x) = a_nx^n+\cdots + a_1x + a_0\) be a polynomial in \(R[x]\). Prove:</p>
            <ol style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li style="list-style-type: none;">(i) \(f(x)\) is nilpotent in \(R[x]\) if and only if each \(a_i\) is nilpotent in \(R\).</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: none;">(ii) \(f(x)\) is a unit in \(R[x]\) if and only if \(a_0\) is a unit and all other \(a_i\) are nilpotent.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Conclude that the nilradical of \(R[x]\) equals the Jacobson radical of \(R[x]\).</p>

            <p><strong>1.</strong> Let \(R\) be a Noetherian ring of Krull dimension \(d\). Prove that the polynomial ring \(R[x]\) has Krull dimension \(d+1\). Conclude that if \((R,\mathfrak{m})\) is a regular local ring and \(M := \langle \mathfrak{m},x\rangle\), then \(R[x]_{M}\) is a regular local ring. Hint: If \(M\subseteq R[x]\) is a maximal ideal, it is helpful to localize \(R\) at \(M\cap R\) and use systems of parameters.</p>
            
            <p><strong>2.</strong> Let \(R\) be a commutative ring and \(R[[x]]\) denote the formal power series ring over \(R\). Addition and multiplication of power series works just like for polynomials. In \(R[[x]]\), one often writes elements with the lower degree terms listed first, i.e., \(f(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2 +\cdots\). Show that \(f\in R[[x]]\) is a unit if and only if \(a_0\) is a unit in \(R\). Conclude that if \((R,\mathfrak{m})\) is quasi-local, then \(R[[x]]\) is also quasi-local.</p>
            
            <p><strong>3.</strong> If \((R,\mathfrak{m})\) is a \(d\)-dimensional local ring, show that \(R[[x]]\) has dimension \(d+1\). Conclude that \(R[[x]]\) is a regular local ring if \(R\) is a regular local ring.</p>
